Here I collect a list of “wisdoms” I’ve picked up throughout my life. This is inspired by the [Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md) by Merlin Mann, and I’d say his introductory remarks with qualifications and context apply equally here.

These are meaningful, insightful, helpful, interesting, or funny to *me*, but your mileage may vary. They’re quotes, phrases, or ideas I think about often, and they’re loosely organized. Attributions to the author noted where known or applicable. The project is never finished.

- Nothing endures but change. *Heraclitus*
- You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who they think can do nothing for them. *Malcolm Forbes*[^1]
- The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause. The mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one. *Wilhelm Stekel*[^2]
- Never ascribe to malice what could be adequately explained by stupidity. 
- When your enemies make mistakes, don’t interrupt them.
- Nothing good happens after midnight. *Deb Gartner*
- Silly icebreakers are a superpower in awkward social situations, especially at work. The template is something innocuous, universal, and specific (only one answer). First concert, first car, first job, movies you've walked out of, best meal you've had on a trip, and so on. My favorite is "fictional universe you'd live in, and what you'd be doing there."  
- Most of the "big questions" don't meaningfully change your day-to-day one way or another. OK, so we live in a simulation. Let's get breakfast.
- Two contradictory things can both be true at the same time.
- Sometimes being the butt of the joke is the coolest thing you can do.
- Ask people about themselves. Listen to what they have to say. Assume everyone you meet just wants to feel understood.
- Round up to whole bills when tipping at restaurants.
- Related: everyone should work a job in the service industry at some point in their lives. You can tell when someone hasn’t.
