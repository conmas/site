Here I collect a list of “wisdoms” I’ve picked up throughout my life. This is inspired by the [Wisdom Project](https://github.com/merlinmann/wisdom/blob/master/wisdom.md) by Merlin Mann, and I’d say his introductory remarks with qualifications and context apply equally here.

These are meaningful, insightful, helpful, interesting, or funny to *me*, but your mileage may vary. They’re quotes, phrases, or ideas I think about often, and they’re loosely organized. Attributions to the author noted where known or applicable. The project is never finished.

- Nothing endures but change. *Heraclitus*
- You can easily judge the character of others by how they treat those who they think can do nothing for them. *Malcolm Forbes*[^1]
- The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause. The mark of a mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one. *Wilhelm Stekel*[^2]
- Never ascribe to malice what could be adequately explained by stupidity. 
- When your enemies make mistakes, don’t interrupt them.
- Nothing good happens after midnight. *Deb Gartner*
- Contradictory things can both be true at the same time.
- Ask people about themselves. Listen to what they have to say.
- Round up to whole bills when tipping at restaurants.
- Related: everyone should work at least one job in the service industry. You can tell when someone hasn’t.

[^1]: I’ve also seen this attributed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
[^2]: Purportedly [misattributed](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Stekel#Misattributed) in *The Catcher in the Rye*, but I’d consider it paraphrasing.
