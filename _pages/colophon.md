# Colophon

This site is designed, developed, written, and published by [Connor Mason](About%20(WolfCo).md) in the suburbs of Chicago. 

Posts and pages are written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer). Templates, layouts, and development files are written and managed using [Nova](https://nova.app).

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). The Jekyll template is adapted and customized from [this one](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template) by Maxime Vaillancourt, and the color scheme [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki), as well as the general layout and structure of the site, were inspired by [Steph Ango](https://stephango.com).
