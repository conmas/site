# Now
Last updated January 20, 2024. This page is inspired by the [`/now`](https://nownownow.com/about) page project.

## Work

I’m currently an engineering leader at McDonald’s focused on a few interesting product and technology challenges that few other companies have. These include:

- Globalization for mobile payments and delivery services
- Using real-time location to automatically prepare orders
- Productizing generative AI for conversational commerce

I’m learning a ton about cloud-native technologies and deployments, cultural and industry differences internationally, and leading a product transformation within an enormous enterprise environment.

## Personal 

Outside of work, I’m focused on life in the Chicago suburbs with my wife Abby and three-year-old son Miles. I’m increasingly (trying to) focus on my health, and I’m coming up on ten months sober.

You can find the latest movies I’ve watched, rated, and reviewed on my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/conmas) profile. Most nights I like to watch awful movies that Abby and I can make fun of together.

I’m reading a few books in fits and starts, including [*All of the Marvels*](https://apple.co/3U85Oub) by Douglas Wolk and [*The Murderbot Diaries*](https://apple.co/48DqfDJ) by Martha Wells.
