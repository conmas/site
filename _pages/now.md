This page is inspired by the [`/now`](https://nownownow.com/about) page project, which focuses on life updates that are more generalized than social media status updates or posts, and instead cover things you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a while.

## Work

I’m working as a product and engineering leader at McDonald’s, focused on a few interesting product and technology challenges that few other companies have. These include:

- Modernizing a legacy digital commerce platform and native apps.
- Expanding digital payments and delivery service capabilities internationally.
- Productizing conversational commerce for order-taking.
- Advancing a lean product operating model transformation in an enormously complex enterprise context.

## Personal 

I’m currently <script>document.write(`${((new Date()-new Date("1991-07-26T13:44:00Z"))/1000/60/60/24/365.25).toFixed(2)}`)</script> years old and counting.

Outside of work, I’m focused on life in the Chicago suburbs with my wife Abby and three-year-old son Miles. I’m increasingly (trying to) focus on my health, and I’m now <script>document.write`${(new Date()-new Date("2023-03-21T00:00:00Z"))/1000/60/60/24/365.25 | 0}+' years,'+{((new Date()-new Date("2023-03-21T00:00:00Z"))/1000/60/60/24 % 365.25)/30.44 | 0} + ' months'`);</script> sober.

You can find the latest movies I’ve watched, rated, and reviewed on my [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/conmas) profile. Most nights I like to watch awful movies that Abby and I can make fun of together.
