# Hi, I’m Connor.

I’m a product and engineering leader in Chicago with a background in design, product, and mobile. Today, I work on digital products & platforms at McDonald’s, leading the global engineering team that builds industry-leading [mobile apps](https://apple.co/3Hll1QM), websites, and kiosks used by millions of customers every day.

I want to make [wonderful](https://bit.ly/3HiCadM) products. Shipping useful tools or thoughtful designs is like writing love letters to a billion strangers. This keeps product work fun, but also reminds me to obsess over the details.

I’m passionate about accessibility, data privacy, and em dashes. I rarely use social media, but when I do, I post about Apple, productivity apps, and smart home platforms. Otherwise, you’ll typically find me drinking coffee and talking with my hands.
