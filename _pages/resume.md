In this role within the Global Customer Tech organization, I lead the engineering and technical teams of the Ordering group.

My team supports key focus areas for the company’s digital growth—including the top priorities of digital, delivery, and drive-thru—and works to extend McDonald’s continuing industry leadership as the #1 food app in the world.
