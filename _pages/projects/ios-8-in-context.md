## Introduction

Historically, Apple’s keynote at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference has been the platform for the introduction of consumer products and features, including the iPhone 4 in 2010 and iOS 7 in 2013. But this year’s conference was different in that the last third of Apple’s presentation addressed zero end-user features at all—instead, Cook and his team delivered technology after technology on thousands of developers’ wish lists.

Despite the introduction of the redesigned OS X Yosemite and the quick glance at consumer features in iOS 8, the focus of this year’s keynote presentation seemed to be the new APIs and extensible capabilities offered up to iOS’s army of developers. New options for app backends, new tools for inter-app communication, and an entirely new programming language took center stage above the flashier consumer features more commonly revealed. The hundreds of developers in attendance cheered as Craig Federighi, Apple’s Senior Vice President of Software Engineering, announced each new capability in rapid succession. But laypeople tuning in to Apple’s event live stream had to be wondering—what are these people so excited about?

The truth is that, while the expert showmanship of previous WWDC keynotes has captured the public’s imagination, the import of this year’s announcements will trump all of them. While non-developers might have been itching for an early glimpse of this fall’s new iPhones, little did they know that these additions to iOS will doubtless have a greater impact on their everyday lives than any hardware or media-friendly new feature. If last year’s sweeping redesign in iOS 7 was a fresh paint job, iOS 8 is an entirely new engine.

This is iOS 8 in context.
