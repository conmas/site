# What’s next from Google: Android L, Nexus 9, and Nexus 6

Although there won’t be a fancy event to accompany the launch of Nexus 6 and 9 smart devices the announcements still merit attention. A blog post from Google is expected to officially reveal the new Nexus devices that will be the first to run the newest version of Android, codenamed L. Per usual, speculation has swirled around what these new devices will look like, feature, and cost—but what will be most impactful is Android L coming to life.

### Android L

Google’s newest operating system, Android L, has been available in beta for developers since its introduction at Google I/O this summer. Tomorrow, alongside the launch of new Nexus hardware from Google’s hardware partners, the next version of Android is expected to be released to the public after tomorrow’s rumored announcements. Most existing Nexus devices will receive the update over the air, as they are frequently the first to receive operating system updates, and other Android devices will gain access to the new version as carriers and manufacturers allow in the coming months. Android L introduces a number of cosmetic changes across the operating system, detailed in Google’s Material Design specifications from this June. But beneath the surface, L grants Android developers all-new backend improvements to increase speed and performance.

> “Android L is going to be a big game-changer for the backend, since it switches from Dalvik to ART for its virtual machine,” said Punchkick Android developer Josh Feinberg. “This will allow apps to run faster, drain less battery, and provide support for future 64-bit applications. It’s a huge benefit but requires zero changes by developers.”

Google has teased its upcoming launch with a few tongue-in-cheek videos mocking its own dessert-oriented nomenclature, suggesting that “L” could signify anything from “Lemon Meringue Pie” to “Lollipop.” (Android moves through major versions in alphabetical order—starting with Cupcake in 2008 and moving through Donut, Eclair, Froyo, Gingerbread, Honeycomb, Ice Cream Sandwich, Jellybean, and most recently, KitKat.) The operating system brings some customer-facing improvements as well, in the form of Google Fit, a health and fitness aggregator to rival Apple’s HealthKit in iOS 8. Android fans have speculated that Android L might represent version 5.0 for the operating system, but Google’s recent version numbers suggest that 4.5 might be more likely. Either way, Google’s upcoming Nexus products will be the public’s first taste of the company’s next desserts.

### Nexus 9

Google’s Nexus series of smartphones and tablets—which have included five smartphones and three tablets to date—represent the pinnacle of Android experiences straight from the search giant itself. Partnering with Android OEMs like Samsung, HTC, and LG in the past, Google releases Nexus products that demonstrate the purest stock Android experiences. Whereas many manufacturers add custom software or rethought interfaces on top of Android—like Samsung’s TouchWiz or HTC’s Sense—Nexus products have attracted Android fans looking for software free of such accouterments.

Following in the footsteps of Google’s popular Nexus 7 flagship 7-inch tablet manufactured by ASUS, the company is allegedly planning to introduce a 9-inch tablet to replace the dated Nexus 10 tablet and more directly compete with Apple’s iPad. Just 24 hours before Apple’s iPad-centric media event in Cupertino, Googlers in Mountain View are expected to announce a 9-inch tablet manufactured by Android partner HTC.

> “I’m most excited for the Nexus announcements, because Nexus devices have always set the standard for the next crop of third-party Android devices to aspire to,” said Feinberg. “Nexus devices show off what Google recommends for the next iteration of hardware, in order to take advantage of the next version of Android.”

### Nexus 6

Coupled with their tablet intentions, Google is expected to introduce a next-generation Android handset to replace last year’s ubiquitous Nexus 5. Presumably called the Nexus 6, this device is rumored to be manufactured by once–Google acquisition Motorola and boast a monster 5.95-inch display. This phone will position Google opposite Apple’s iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as more modern Android competitors from Samsung’s Galaxy Note 4, Motorola’s new X, and HTC’s One (M8) from earlier this year.

> “The Nexus 6 might also follow the pattern of releasing multiple sizes,” said Feinberg, “which would be awesome for users who don't want phablets.”

Because of its manufacturer, considering past trends of repurposing internal components and capabilities from hardware partners’ other flagships (the Nexus 5 was essentially LG’s G2 in a different shell, for example), it’s likely the Nexus 6 will share hardware specifications with Motorola’s Moto X from last month. Whether Google announces the Nexus 6 tomorrow or waits to give the handset due attention at a future media event, the device is sure to inform many of Google’s software and design decisions going forward.

Google released several ads teasing the yet-to-be-seen Nexus devices, and they are amazingly entertaining. Andy the Android character is seen in all different shapes and sizes celebrating together and flaunting the tagline “Be together. Not the same.” Google is likely making a jab at Apple’s one-size-fits-all mobile approach, but may also be saluting the push to unite all different types of devices under the newest operating system’s singular banner. Sit back and enjoy these clips.
